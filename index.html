				<h3>Wumpus World AI in Minecraft: </h3>
					<a href="https://0o0liver.github.io/XDLMAO/">Project Website</a>
					<p>
						Summary: <br>
						Our group decided to try and create the Wumpus World AI within Minecraft using Microsoft's Project Malmo library. <br>
						Using Malmo, we designed the Wumpus World game and its rules within Minecraft. <br>
						We made it so that our agent would run on randomly generated worlds with different sizes as well as a varying number of pits. <br>
						Each block of the map represents a different cell in the Wumpus World and type of block the agent stands on determines what it senses in the area. <br>
						The agent will blindly traverse the map using a search algorithm so that it can backtrack once it finds an obstacle or a dead end. <br>
						Towards the end of the project we started experimenting with different search algorithms starting with a DFS algorithm, <br>
						then DFS with Djikstra's for the backtracking, A* without a heuristic, and A* with a heuristic.<br>
						The heuristic used for A* was based on the number of nearby blocks that have been explored within a certain radius from a given block. <br>
